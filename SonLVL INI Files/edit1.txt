Usage:
  vgm2smps <input_file_name> [<output_file_name>] [-fm_enable=1]
    [-fm_chls=111111] [-psg_enable=1]
    [psg_chls=1111] [-fps=60] [-length=0] [-start=0] [-fm_enable_keyoff_notes=0]
 [-dac_export=0]
Parameters:
  [<output_file_name>]
    Output SMPS file name.
    Default: <input_file_name>, but with.bin extension.
  [-fm_enable=1]
    Enable FM. Can be either enabled (1) or disabled (0).
    Default: 1
  [-fm_chls=111111]
    Enable FM channels.Can be either enabled(1) or disabled(0).
    If you only want to disable first three channels, you may write - fm_chls=00
0
    Default: 111111
  [-psg_enable=1]
    Same as FM, but with a PSG.
  [-psg_chls=1111]
    Same as FM, but with a PSG.
  [-fps=60]
    Set the parsing speed.
  [-length=0]
    Set the output SMPS length in frames.
    Default: 0 -- source's length.
  [-start=0]
    Set the start song offset in frames.
    Default: 0 -- without an offset.
  [-fm_enable_keyoff_notes=0]
    Enable support of notes even if key is off.
    SMPS does not support frequency changing after key off.
    Warning! Result may be corrupt.
    Default: 0
  [-dac_export=0]
    Enable found DAC samples from the VGM file. Saves into input file folder.
  [-altins=0]
    Enable altarnate "smart" instrument and note detecting.
    If real frequency (Hz) of note is lower then 0 octave,
    instrument makes lower and notes makes upper in octave.

Usage: smps2asm 
[-b|--bank {ptrtable} 
[-x|--extract [{pointer}]] 
[-u|--saxman] [
-o|--offset {offsetval}]
[-s|--sfx]
{-v|--sonicver} {version}
[-3|--s3kmode] {input_filename} {outpu
t_filename} {projname}

        -s,--sfx        File is SFX, not music.
        -b,--bank       Extracts an entire z80 bank whose pointer table is at ptrtable.
                        The pointer table must reside in the bank, and this option cannot
                        be combined with --extract or with --saxman.
                        Since this is for extracting z80 banks, it is not compatible with
                        --sonicver 1. If missing, ptrtable is assumed to be zero.
        -u,--saxman     Assume music file is Saxman-compressed. In most cases, this
                        should be combined with --offset 0x1380 --sonicver 2.
        -x,--extract    Extract from {pointer} address in file. This should never be
                        combined with --offset unless --saxman is also used.
        -o,--offset     Assumes starting pointer for music/sfx within its soundbank
                        is {offsetval}. Ignored if used with --sonicver 1.
        -v,--sonicver   Sets Sonic version to {version}. This also sets underlying
                        SMPS type. {version} can be '1' Sonic 1, '2' for Sonic 2 or
                        '3' for Sonic 3, '4' for Sonic & Knuckles, or '5' for Sonic
                        3D Blast.
        -3,--s3kmode    This flag is valid for Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 only; this will
                        cause all sequences of durations after a rest to be printed
                        with the rests shown explicitly.
                        WARNING: A smpsCall is assumed to set the note to something.
                        other than a rest; this assumption turns out to be correct
                        for all Sonic 1 and Sonic 2 songs and SFX, but it couldbe
                        wrong for another game with a compatible SMPS implementation.
                        Use with care.
